In lab 8 we were supposed to learn how to use functions, loops, lists, and random numbers.
We were able to accomplish this by using four functions, a list, random numbers, a while loop, and a main function.
The steps we followed and used to solve the problem were creating an algorithm to plan our code, reading and understanding
the prompt, coding our algorithm and testing it several times to make sure it works.
The key concepts explored were while loops, functions, lists, and random numbers.
My results did match what I expected to get. Some of the challenges we encountered was putting the code into the functions 
because we knew how to code it without functions, but then separating the functions and creating the parameters were difficult. 
We followed the first three rules of programming by planning, creating a human-readable essay, and testing our code several times.
We overcame the obstacles by asking for help and with lots of trial and error. A key takeaway I have from this lab is that 
functions are very particular and specificity matters to the t. I do think I learned what I was supposed to from this lab 
because I am more comfortable with functions now and learning how parameters operate. Working with Jalen was great, we 
communicated and worked well together.
